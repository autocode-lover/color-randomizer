write a function where at each click of the button the generated hexvalue in the function named hexValueGenerator is appied to the body of the webpage

also suggest a way where the button's CSS property is set to the background color that is to be changed in realtion to the hex value created in the JS

explain each steps, im a beginner

tell me where i am so far wrong, and how i get to improve

im a bit confused on the function hexValueGenerator() where i have written this inside the for loop, i get that the random character is incremented 6 times hexColor += hexValue[randomHexValue()]; , so explain in depth on how a function shall be used in the place of the i variable
